# KoronaC#
KoronaC#, a Novel Coronavirus tracker (redone in C# and WPF for a much nicer UI)

![Preview](https://i.ibb.co/MgMQFZP/korona.png)
# How it Works
Korona grabs it's data from a .json file from John Hopkins University (thanks so much :D) and then deserializes the file to a class using the "Newtonsoft.JSON" library. It then updates the text on a TextBlock. Simple.

# Requirements
- Windows
- Internet Connection

# Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Refresh by clicking the blue button.
3. Get unreasonably sad upon viewing the number of deaths that this virus has caused :(

# Enjoy!
I'm actually begging for feedback, please, test it out and tell me what would be a good addition. 

Thank you, have a nice day.
